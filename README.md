# BasicProgressTracker
This is a very simple application that I use to track the number of hours I wanted to put in a task and the number of hours remaining before I hit the mark.

TODO:
1. Add Documentation.
2. Beautify the application.
3. Add delete option for tasks.
4. Add option for viewing archaived tasks.
5. Add export option for archaive.
